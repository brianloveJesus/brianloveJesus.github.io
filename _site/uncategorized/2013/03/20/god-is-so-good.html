<p>Hallelu Yah, Praise God in His sanctuary; praise him in his mighty heavens!<br />
Praise him for his mighty deeds; praise him according to his excellent greatness!<br />
Praise him with trumpet sound; praise him with lute and harp!<br />
Praise him with tambourine and dance; praise Him with strings and pipe!<br />
Praise Him with sounding cymbals; praise Him with loud clashing cymbals!<br />
Let everything that has breath praise the LORD! Hallelu Yah!</p>
