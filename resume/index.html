<p>i have been baptized in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit the 27 February 2006.</p>
<p>i generally attend Union Church of Guatemala, a neat interdenominational mostly protestant church with good young adult fellowship though i sometimes attend other churches here like vida real and casa libertad. i do not fully endorse any church i know of but i have been cared for by many churches and i think pastors generally do a good service. i do not normally recommend leaving churches but try to recommend obediently working with God that errors may be fixed in ourselves and in all the worldwide church. i do think it is important to point out what is erroneous teaching to others when we are convinced about it, trying to follow correct procedures in doing so and being careful. </p>
<p>i believe that the 66 book cannon of the Bible is alone infallibly inspired scripture, i think God speaks now through His Holy Spirit and gifts such as prophecy but it is not to be considered anywhere near the value of this cannon of scripture. Still i believe it is acceptable to examine such things as if Ephesians was really penned by paul (i think it is :) or if possibly other books in the apocrypha might be scripture or Hebrews is not but i find efforts point to the infallibility of this 66 book cannon. I believe the teachings of Jesus are the most important of the Bible, followed by those of His apostles, and that the external teachings and commands of the old testament are valuable and true but in regards to the law it was a type of shadow of things to come, and a nanny to us until the coming of Jesus Christ, who gave us a new covenant which is much more rigorous, but the sacrifice for our sins is provided by Christ and we have a helper, the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The most important command is that we love God, which is to be obedient to His commands: that we hold to the name of Jesus Christ and love other believers even as God has loved us, loving our neighbors as ourselves, works which come fromÂ a living faith in Jesus Christ which is a gift of God and not by our own efforts. Walking in love is to obey all of Jesus' commands, from washing the feet of the saints, turning the other cheek, giving all we have to be sold for the poor and helping each other achieve these things, the teachings of the apostles also help us such as knowing it is good to have sufficient employment to take care of our own needs and help others, and that proverbs of the old testament can still be applied to make good decisions. Obedience to all this a product of the working of the Holy Spirit, fully by the grace of God the Father who so greatly loves us praise Him in Jesus name. I understand that if we believe that Jesus is who He said He was, the Son of God, everything else will be produced for our salvation, but with that i tell you to strive to enter the narrow door.</p>
