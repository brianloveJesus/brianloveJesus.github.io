<p>Hi, I am an evangelist that is looking to work for the kingdom of God fulltime in whichever way that might look. I am hoping to model myself first after Jesus of course, which is so hard but i also take as an example Paul, in wanting to not make use of my rights and earn my own bread. Hope i work towards being the last to enjoy rights even to be considered the scum of the earth as he was in 1st Corinthias 4. With this I think it is important to have a balanced view of things and know nothing is evil in its own right but everything is good as long as it is received with thanksgiving and prayer and God gives us everything richly for our enjoyment, though with this I think the foremost thing we are to enjoy is God and His word, even to the point of dimming everything else to rubbish, making our primary hope the grace to be given when Jesus Christ is revealed.</p>
<p>For now I feel I am being balanced out to learn how to draw people to Jesus, and know how to remain in Him myself; knowing the height, depth, width and breadth of God's Love. A Love which is so very very vast. I have experienced this through many wonderful interactions that God has allowed me to witness in Him, as well as the grace He exhibits through His body and the way He communicates truth through His Spirit. I mention all these things as what I focus on, I have committed many mistakes and am far from perfect, but I hope that this site proves useful to His kingdom in some way.</p>
