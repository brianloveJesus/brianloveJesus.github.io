  content: God bless you, i'm pretty bad at taking care of widows and orphans and
    remained unstained from the world would like to be religious though, sorry i haven't
    kept up the site much, the Lord delivered me from allergies, bipolar disorder,
    cured my dog of cataracts (and while He loves His creation, He came for people)
    and well He is simply awesome, taste and see that the Lord is good, in Jesus name

<p>Hallelu Yah, Praise God in His sanctuary; praise him in his mighty heavens!<br />
Praise him for his mighty deeds; praise him according to his excellent greatness!<br />
Praise him with trumpet sound; praise him with lute and harp!<br />
Praise him with tambourine and dance; praise Him with strings and pipe!<br />
Praise Him with sounding cymbals; praise Him with loud clashing cymbals!<br />
Let everything that has breath praise the LORD! Hallelu Yah!</p>
